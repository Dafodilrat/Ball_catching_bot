# üèÄ Ball Catching Bot ‚Äî ROS 2 Powered Mecanum Robot

This repository contains the ROS 2 implementation for a mobile robot that tracks, localizes, and navigates to intercept a projectile (ball). The robot is based on the **rosmaster x3** platform, running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and fully containerized with Docker.

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

The system is organized into four major modules:

- **Trajectory Tracking** ‚Äî Predicts ball landing point using `/rosmaster` node.
- **Control Module** ‚Äî PID-based velocity controller for 4 mecanum wheels.
- **Sensor Inputs** ‚Äî Integrates Astra camera, IMU, and encoder data.
- **Localization** ‚Äî EKF fusing IMU and encoder data to provide stable `/odom`.

## üß© ROS 2 Packages

| Package | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pkg_motor_driver` | Converts `/cmd_vel` into low-level motor commands |
| `pkg_pid_controller` | PID-based control for tracking x, y, yaw trajectories |
| `rosmaster` | Publishes predicted projectile landing coordinates |
| `robot_description` | Contains robot URDF and state publisher |
| `astra_camera` | Depth and RGB camera interface |
| `robot_localization` | EKF-based fusion of IMU and encoder for accurate localization |

## ü¶æ Robot Control

The robot uses 3 PID controllers for linear `x`, `y` and angular `yaw` control. Final wheel speeds are computed with mecanum kinematic equations:

```math
M1 = (Vy - Vx + (L+W) * Wz) / R
M2 = (Vy + Vx + (L+W) * Wz) / R
M3 = (Vy - Vx - (L+W) * Wz) / R
M4 = (Vy + Vx - (L+W) * Wz) / R
```

Each motor command is sent to the driver node via `/cmd_vel`.

---

## üß≠ Localization

Uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) via `robot_localization` package:
- Inputs: IMU (acceleration, gyro) + Encoders
- Output: `/odom` transform and velocity estimates
- Config: `robot_localization/config/ekf.yaml`
